# sticky-column
Allows for a column to be stick with you while you scroll!

## Something I built a couple years ago
I built this for a checkout page, and seems to still be really useful to me!

## Usage:
Add js-non-sticky column to the column you want the sticky column to follow and your job is done!

```javascript
 Â stickColumn({
    nonStickyColumn: $('.js-non-sticky-column'),
    stickyColumn: $('.js-sticky-column'),
  });
```
